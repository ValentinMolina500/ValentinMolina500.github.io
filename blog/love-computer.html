        <h1>I love my computer :)</h1>
        <p>Ah, my computer.</p>
        <p>It's where I spend most my days, punching away (sometimes literally) at a keyboard.</p>
        <p>When I need entertainment, I turn to my computer. If I need to get work done, back to the computer. Even school is on my computer.</p>
        <p>
            Don't get it twisted, I really do love my computer. Why else would I voluntarily sit here for hours on end?
            Social life be damned. Besides, social media sites exist. Surely they fill that need for socialization quite fine.
            And even better because they can be easily reached from my computer.
        </p>

        <p>
            While others were gathering in their social circles, I studied the computer.

        <p>...<p>

        <p>
            I've been trying to take care of myself more lately.
            Sleeping more, trying to not eat everything I set my sights on, that sort of thing.
        <p>

        <p>
            I've been taking walks with my dog, have started using a calendar to organize work and school
            responsibilities, and let me tell you, it's doing wonders for my general stress level.
        </p>

        <p>
            I really do love my computer though. It's given me work, endless hours of entertainment, and connected
            me with more people than I'd wish it has.
        </p>

        <p>
            I want to appreciate it as best I can. So that means I'll be logging off more often.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the saying goes: too much of a good thing, is not a good thing (Wow, Wow, Wubzzy)
